      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directions.
        Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate,
        and entertain our audience! As one or our member told us:</p>
      <blockquote>&quot;Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family member. I think of it as the gift of
        knowledge...and that is princeless.&quot;</blockquote>
